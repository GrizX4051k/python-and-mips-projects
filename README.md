# Python and MIPS Projects

_Link to my website (coming soon)_ <!-- TODO: add link to a GitHub Pages site later -->

A curated collection of my early Python projects and MIPS assembly work, plus a robotics report – organized like a real codebase instead of a random class backup.

## Why this repo exists

I wanted one **clean, professional** home for all my early Python and MIPS assembly work.  
Instead of scattered folders, this repository shows:

- How I build console apps in Python that feel like real tools, not just homework.
- How I experiment with low‑level MIPS assembly alongside higher‑level Python.
- How I document and archive projects (including a robotics report) so another developer or reviewer can follow my thinking.

If you’re a reviewer, this is the best place to see how I started thinking in Python and assembly before moving to bigger web/backend projects.

## Project map

Each folder is a focused area. Most have their own README with context and run instructions.

| Folder                 | Focus                                | Highlights                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `python-projects`      | Python console applications          | Calculators, small systems, college work  |
| `mips-assembly-project`| MIPS assembly practice               | Core instructions, algorithms, I/O        |
| `docs`                 | Supporting documents (PDF reports)   | Robotic arm project report                |

Inside `python-projects` there are multiple projects (see that folder’s README for a detailed map).

## How to run (quick start)

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GrizX4051k/python-and-mips-projects.git
cd python-and-mips-projects

Python projects
You need Python 3 installed.

Example (Polygon Area Calculator):

bash
cd python-projects/"Polygon Area Calculator"
python main.py
Example (Time Calculator):

bash
cd python-projects/"Time calculator"
python main.py
Each Python project folder has its own README with a short description and exact command to run.

```

## MIPS assembly project

You can run the MIPS programs using a simulator such as MARS or QtSPIM.

Typical flow:

- Open mips-assembly-project in your MIPS IDE/simulator.

- Load one of the .asm files (c.asm, Icrand.asm, mips1.asm).

- Assemble and run inside the simulator.

- Check the README in mips-assembly-project for more details.

## Engineering practices in this repo

This repo is not just a dump of files; I use it to practice real engineering habits.

- Clear separation by language and purpose
- Python and MIPS are split into their own top‑level folders.

Documents like the robotic arm report live under docs, not mixed with source files.

Small, focused projects
- Each Python project is scoped to a single idea (a calculator, a management system, a college assignment).
- This makes it easy for reviewers to open any folder, understand the goal, and inspect the code.

Command‑line first
- All Python projects are designed to run from the terminal with simple commands.
- This keeps them portable across Windows, Linux (Ubuntu/WSL), and macOS.

---

 ## Tech stack
 
Language: Python 3, MIPS assembly

Tools: Python interpreter, MARS / QtSPIM (or similar MIPS simulator)

OS: Windows (primary), Linux/WSL for some workflows

---

## Roadmap

Over time I plan to:

- Add more detailed READMEs and screenshots for each Python project.

- Include sample inputs/outputs so visitors can quickly see what each script does.

- Extend the MIPS section with more documented examples and comments.

## About me

I’m Manish Kumar (@GrizX4051k), an aspiring software engineer who likes to organize even early projects as if they were going into a real production repository.

If you’re browsing this as a recruiter or engineer:

You’ll see how I write and structure small Python tools.

You’ll see that I’m not afraid of low‑level assembly work.

You can open any folder and quickly understand what it is, why it exists, and how to run it.

Feel free to open issues with suggestions or refactors – I’m actively growing this repo as I level up.
