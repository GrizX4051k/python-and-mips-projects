# Time Calculator (Python)

A small utility to perform basic time calculations, such as adding durations or finding differences between times.

## What this project demonstrates

- Working with hours/minutes (and possibly seconds).
- Converting user input into a consistent internal representation.
- Formatting output cleanly back to human-readable time.

## Features (depending on your code)

- Add two time values.
- Subtract one time from another.
- Normalize results (e.g. 90 minutes → 1 hour 30 minutes).

## How to run

```bash
cd python-projects/"Time calculator"
python main.py
