# Probability Calculator (Python)

A console-based helper for basic probability calculations.

## What this project demonstrates

- Translating simple probability formulas into Python code.
- Handling fractions, percentages, and conditional logic.
- Designing a small menu or mode selection (if you support multiple types of problems).

## Possible capabilities

Depending on your implementation, this project may:

- Compute simple probability of single events.
- Combine probabilities for independent/dependent events.
- Convert between fraction and percentage representations.

## How to run

```bash
cd python-projects/"Probability Calculator"
python main.py
