# College Project â€“ Python Mini Projects

This folder contains my **College Project** Python work: a collection of small, selfâ€‘contained programs based on typical CS assignments (graphics, games, file I/O, algorithms, grading, and basic AIâ€‘style recommendation).

Each subfolder is a standalone miniâ€‘project with its own README and Python files.
