# Airline Management System (Python)

A console-based Airline Management System written in Python.  
It simulates core airline operations like managing flights, passengers, and basic ticket booking in a text interface.

## What this project demonstrates

- Object-Oriented Programming in Python (classes for flights, passengers, etc.).
- Working with lists/dictionaries to store and manipulate data.
- Menu-driven console UI and input validation.

## Features (typical flow)

- Add, update, or list available flights.
- Register passengers.
- Book or cancel tickets.
- Display simple reports (e.g. passenger lists or flight details).

> This is a learning project, not a real production system, but it mirrors how basic airline workflows can be modeled in code.[web:17][web:20]

## How to run

From the repo root:

```bash
cd python-projects/"Airline Managment System"
