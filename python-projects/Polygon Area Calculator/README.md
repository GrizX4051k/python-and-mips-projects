# Polygon Area Calculator (Python)

A Python program to calculate the area of a regular polygon based on the number of sides and the length of each side.[web:18][web:21]

## What this project demonstrates

- Using math formulas in Python.
- Working with user input and floating-point numbers.
- Separating input, calculation, and output logic.

## Formula (concept)

For a regular polygon with `n` sides of length `s`, the area can be computed using a standard geometry formula (see typical textbook or online resources).[web:18]

## How to run

```bash
cd python-projects/"Polygon Area Calculator"
python main.py
