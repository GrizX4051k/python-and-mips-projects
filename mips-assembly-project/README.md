# MIPS Assembly Project

This folder contains my MIPS assembly practice files.

## Files

- `c.asm`
- `Icrand.asm`
- `mips1.asm`

Each file explores different instructions, control flow, or algorithms in MIPS.

## How to run

Use a MIPS simulator such as MARS or QtSPIM:

1. Open the simulator.
2. Load one of the `.asm` files from this folder.
3. Assemble (compile) the program.
4. Run it and inspect the registers / memory as needed.

These programs were originally written as part of academic work to understand low‑level architecture and instruction behavior.
