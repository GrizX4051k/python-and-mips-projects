# MIPS Assembly Project

This folder contains my MIPS assembly practice files.

## Files

- `c.asm` – small C-style exercise rewritten in MIPS (loops, arithmetic, basic I/O).
- `Icrand.asm` – integer/random demo, practicing syscalls and simple pseudo-random logic.
- `mips1.asm` – first MIPS lab program focusing on core instructions and control flow.


Each file explores different instructions, control flow, or algorithms in MIPS.

## How to run

Use a MIPS simulator such as MARS or QtSPIM:

1. Open the simulator.
2. Load one of the `.asm` files from this folder.
3. Assemble (compile) the program.
4. Run it and inspect the registers / memory as needed.

These programs were originally written as part of academic work to understand low‑level architecture and instruction behavior.
